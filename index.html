<p>Welcome! My name is Saloni Bhogale, and I am pursuing an M.S. in <b> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://polisci.wisc.edu/">Statistics (Applied Statistics)</a></b> and a PhD in <b> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://polisci.wisc.edu/">Political Science</a></b> at the <b> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.wisc.edu/">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a></b>, focusing on Comparative Politics & Political Methodology.
</p>
  <p>  
 I study political institutions and the political economy of development in the Global South.  My research focuses on understanding factors that facilitate access to justice in developing countries, and how institutional norms affect judicial institutions. </p>
 
 <p>
 In my job market paper titled "Village Councils and Access to Justice", I study factors that can enhance legal accessibility in developing countries, particularly the dual role played by elected members of a village council in dispute resolution and legal mobilization, using original data from over four million court cases, spanning 27,000 villages. I received generous funding for this work from the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://newcollege.asu.edu/law-and-science-diss-grant"><b> National Science Foundation's Law and Science Dissertation Grant.</a> </b></p>
 
 <p>  
  I employ a wide variety of tools from causal inference, and have leveraged tools from machine learning and conducted qualitative interviews to guide my work. In a second line of research, I study how flexible machine learning (ML) methods can be used for causal inference, particularly for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects.</p>

  <p>I am affiliated with UW-Madison's <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/"><b>Center for High Throughput Computing</a> </b> and leverage scientific computing to improve performance of tasks in the research pipeline.</p>

  <p>Prior to graduate school, I spent two years as a Research Fellow at Ashoka University, where I conducted research, managed student researchers and developed software tools for researchers and journalists. </p>

<p>You can find a copy of my <b><a href = "cv/CV.pdf">CV here</a></b>. Please feel free to reach out to me! </p>
